* Traffic Mirroring is an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon EC2 instances. You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for:
  * Content inspection
  * Threat monitoring
  * Troubleshooting

* Key benefits of traffic mirroring:
  * Simplified native operation:
      * Instead of using an agent to have mirroring capability, you now can use VPC traffic mirroring, natively.
  * Improved security posture:
      * Through allowing packet capture at the elastic network interface level
  * Wide range of monitoring options:
      * Integrating with multiple tools and partners, VPC traffic mirroring allows you to mix and match options

* You can use it for:
  * Visibility and Troubleshooting
  * Detection of network and security anomalies
