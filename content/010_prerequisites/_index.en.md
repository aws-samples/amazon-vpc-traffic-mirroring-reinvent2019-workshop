### Before we begin...


* To start the session, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

{{< tabs name="Start" >}}
{{{< tab name="AWS Host Event" include="./aws_event/" />}}
{{{< tab name="In Your Own Account" include="./self_paced/" />}}
{{< /tabs >}}

* Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create Infrastructure**](./createinfra)


<!--
Another way to present:
* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](self_paced/), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](aws_event/)
-->
