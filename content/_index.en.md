* In this builder session we will explore how to gain insight into your network traffic using Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring. We will learn how to copy network traffic from an       elastic network interface (ENI) from your EC2 instances into your VPCs and send it to the security and monitoring appliances. We will walk through solutions available on AWS       Marketplace - that can be used as IDS/IPS.
* Before we begin we briefly go over what a network can look like and what are different native traffic monitoring capabilities available within AWS cloud.
