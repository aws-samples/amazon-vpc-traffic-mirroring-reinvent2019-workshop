# Objective:

* You might want to use single target for multiple sources. In doing so target can become resource constrained. In this activity we explore how you can use scale target by front ending them with a network load balancer (NLB) and use NLB as a target instead. At the end of this activity you will learn how to successfully configure NLB as a target
* Activity has sections for both console and aws cli.
